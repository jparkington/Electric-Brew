## Important Data Points from CMP Bills

### Overview
Each of the 7 accounts in CMP has a series of PDFs available for that account. A new one is generated on roughly a monthly cadence. Each PDF contains some data points of interest to us, assuming that the rate reported in each PDF's billing section is not variable.

There is a sample bill in this folder, which we'll use as a guideline for what to record.

### What to Retrieve from Each Bill
The following data points from each bill should be recorded somewhere for us to turn into an underlying data table
- Account Number
- Number of Days
- Bill Start Date
- Bill End Date
- Amount Due
- KWH Hours Recorded (e.g. 1487)
- Delivery Service Rate Charged (e.g. 0.077711)
- Service Charge (e.g. 21.47)

When entering these numbers into the sheet, just enter numerical values and decimal points, not ($) or string labels like "KWH".
