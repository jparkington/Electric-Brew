# Project (template)

Replace the content of this README.md with content relevant to your project, including: 

* project name
* team members (identify the team lead)
* stakeholder
* project "story"
* links to any relevant publicly accessible datasets

## NOTE to students

* This repository is a template of your team project in DS 5110.
* Only one member of the team (the team lead) should use this template.
* With your stakeholder's permission and consent from your entire team, you may eventually make this repo 
  publicly accessible with a [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/) site.
