## Story
Austin Street Brewery, a thriving craft beer brewery situated in Maine, is at an exciting stage of its growth trajectory. With expansion comes opportunities for innovation, and the brewery's energy infrastructure is a prime example. Currently, energy consumption is measured through seven different electricity meters, each tied to various operational facets of the brewery, from brewing and packaging to maintaining a welcoming atmosphere in the tasting room.

As a forward-thinking establishment, Austin Street Brewery has already made strides towards sustainability by sourcing 15% of their energy from solar power and are keen to understand how they might increase this proportion effectively. With multiple supplier contracts and the complexity that comes with sustainable energy sources, there exists a unique opportunity to streamline their energy management practices.

In collaboration with Luke Truman from the New England Environmental Finance Center (NEEFC), whom has a proven track record in aiding craft beverage producers in enhancing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, Austin Street Brewery aims to leverage data science for the following objectives:

1. [**Operational cost mapping**](#exploratory-data-analysis) to understand which meters should power which equipment.
2. Benchmarking against industry standards to identify areas for improvement.
3. Analysis of total [**energy usage**](#usage-analysis) to compare the cost-efficiency of solar versus conventional suppliers.
4. Unbiased [**peak hour and supplier**](#peak-hour--supplier-modeling) recommendations based on unsupervised machine learning models.


## Installation & Usage

This project utilizes [**Conda**](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) for managing dependencies and environments. Conda enables the creation of isolated environments that can house specific versions of packages, making it easier to manage complex projects. It's particularly well-suited for Python-based data science projects, ensuring that all dependencies are compatible and can be easily installed or removed.

### Setting Up the Environment

For the shortest path to getting up and running, you can simply run the command below, which will create the Conda environment and ensure the pathing is set up properly for subsequent commands and ad hoc querying.

```bash
make setup
```  

Note that each script containing a plot saves a PNG file in the `.fig` directory after being closed by the user.

The entire ETL process is ready for you upon cloning the repo. However, you can reproduce the scraping, curating, and modeling steps with the command below.

```bash
make etl
```

## Analysis

In the Analysis section, we delve into the interconnected themes of operational efficiency, cost management, and sustainable energy use at Austin Street Brewery. Our approach reveals the complex interplay between energy consumption patterns, cost implications, and the potential of renewable energy sources. We uncover insights into how different operational areas contribute to overall energy usage, identifying specific periods and practices that drive up costs. 

This analysis is not just about pinpointing areas of high consumption but also understanding the underlying factors contributing to these patterns. We then explore the financial and environmental aspects of the brewery's energy mix, evaluating the current balance between conventional and solar energy and projecting future scenarios. The culmination of our analysis offers strategic recommendations, leveraging advanced modeling to propose optimizations in energy usage and supplier relationships. 

Throughout this section, our focus remains on providing a holistic view that blends operational practicality with a vision for sustainable growth, offering Austin Street Brewery a roadmap to not only reduce costs but also enhance their environmental footprint.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

```bash
make jp01
```
![01 - kWh vs. Total Cost](<./fig/analysis/jp/01 - kWh vs. Total Cost.png>)

Our analysis of the relationship between kilowatt-hours (kWh) and total cost is pivotal in strategizing for maximum energy efficiency at the lowest possible cost, a relationship that underpins each of our project's objectives. The data, encompassing over 335,000 entries, indicates considerable variability in both energy usage and cost, as evidenced by the average kWh usage of **0.845** with a standard deviation of **1.295**, and an average total cost of **$0.13** per reading with a standard deviation of **$0.23**. This variability is further underscored by the right-skewed distribution for both metrics, pointing to infrequent but significant spikes in energy usage and cost.

A key insight from this analysis is the strong positive correlation of **0.846** between kWh and total cost. This correlation, while indicative of a general trend where increased energy usage leads to higher costs, also reveals the intricacies of this relationship due to the static rates from CMP, suppliers, and Ampion. The pattern-driven, striated nature observed in the scatter plot underscores that the cost dynamics are not simply linear but are influenced by these structured rate tiers.

These insights suggest a huge opportunity for strategic operational adjustments, specifically targeting periods where high energy usage does not proportionally equate to high costs. Identifying these cost-efficient periods, possibly due to favorable rate structures or operational efficiencies, can lead to significant savings.

```bash
make jp02
```
![02 - Hourly Variation of kWh by Month](<./fig/analysis/jp/02 - Hourly Variation of kWh by Month.png>)

Following our examination of the kWh versus total cost relationship, the analysis of hourly kWh usage by month uncovers its stark seasonal variations, reflecting the brewery's heightened energy demands during the colder months, likely exacerbated by the need for heating during Maine's harsh winters. That necessity had become even more pronounced in the context of COVID-19, whcih we'll explore in later charts.

From the data, we observe that the energy usage peaks in the winter months, with January and December recording the highest average kWh usage at **0.94** and **0.96** respectively. This trend is indicative of increased heating requirements and possibly a higher operational pace during the holiday season. In contrast, the milder months of April and May show the lowest energy consumption, averaging at **0.75** and **0.73** kWh. The hourly breakdown within each month further reveals a consistent pattern of energy usage ramping up during the morning hours, peaking in the midday to early afternoon, and then gradually declining towards the night. This pattern aligns with typical operational hours and suggests that most energy-intensive activities occur during the day, tapering off as the brewery closes for the night.

Aligning energy-intensive processes with periods of lower kWh usage, especially during off-peak hours, could save on operational costs, assuming variables rates are available for Austin Street to opt into. Implementing energy storage solutions could also be beneficial, allowing the brewery to store energy during off-peak hours for use during peak demand times.

<br>

```bash
make jp03
```
![03 - Average Cost by Period Over Time](<./fig/analysis/jp/03 - Average Cost by Period Over Time.png>)

Building on our earlier analyses, the scatter plot depicting average cost by period over time at Austin Street Brewery underscores the nuances in their energy usage, particularly under the lens of peak and off-peak hours. A key observation from the data is the brewery's tendency towards higher energy usage during peak hours, as reflected in the average costs: **$0.14** for mid-peak, **$0.09** for off-peak, and **$0.13** for on-peak hours. This pattern is pivotal, as it suggests that a straightforward transition to a variable rate plan, without adjusting operational practices, might not be as beneficial as hoped.

In short, the concentration of data points during peak hours in the scatter plot indicates that the brewery's current energy-intensive activities align with generally more expensive energy periods. This presents an opportunity for strategic operational adjustments, such as rescheduling certain activities to off-peak hours, which could lead to more substantial cost savings. This approach, however, needs to be balanced with the practicalities of brewery operations, ensuring that any changes do not adversely affect productivity or product quality.
