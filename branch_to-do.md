1. Get `scrape_ampion_bills` and `scrape_cmp_bills` operational again with a DataFrame structure
2. Test all curation scripts in the `curation.py` section
3. Completely rework documentation in `/src/README.md` to account for the new DRY curation functions
4. Ensure `curation.py` is mentioned at the end of the documentation
5. Consider a new name for `curation.py`
6. Design Make commands for `curation.py` or whatever name it becomes
